          <div className = "introduction">
            <p>I'm 20 years old and I study Computer Science at University of Verona (UniVr).
                I am a sociable person with a natural sense of humor, although I can
                sometimes be slightly reserved. I am inherently curious and always
                eager to learn new knowledge and skills. I serve as a scout leader, a
                role I pursue with passion and dedication. In my free time, I enjoy
                playing the guitar, exploring the world of video games, spending
                quality time with friends, and listening to music, with a particular
                fondness for rap.
            </p>
